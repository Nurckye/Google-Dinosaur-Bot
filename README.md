# Google-Dinosaur-Bot
Simple python script that jumps over obstacle in the Dinosaur game from Google Chrome. The values are hardcoded because there python doesn't know where the dinosaur and obstacles are.
Also the browser window needs to stay in a fixed position depending on the values set for the position of the dinosaur and the replay button.
Use: xdotool getmouselocation to get the coordonates for dinosaur and the replay button
